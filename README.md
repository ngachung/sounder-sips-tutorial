## Quick Start

This guide provides a quick way to get started with our project.

### Setup Instructions

1. In Jupyter hub, start a new terminal process. After logging in, the launcher allows you to open a new terminal.
2. Double click the 'terminal' icon under 'Other' to open a new terminal.
3. Once the terminal is open, enter the following command to clone the tutorial repository to your local environment:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/unity-sds/sounder-sips-tutorial.git
```

**Note**: if you receive an error like:
```
bash: git: command not found
```
it means the environment you have set up does not have the git command line installed. This usually happens when using the *minimal* environment in jupyter. To fix this, you can run the following command:

```
conda install git
```

and re-run the command.

After a few seconds, you should see a folder called 'sounder-sips-tutorial' in the file navigator on the left hand side.

Double click on that folder to view the contents of the repository within your own jupyter environment. To access the welcome notebook, click:

```
sounder-sips-tutorial > jupyter-notebooks > welcome.ipynb
```

To access a specific tutorial, click:

```
sounder-sips-tutorial > jupyter-notebooks > tutorials
```
