# sounder-sips-tutorial

This tutorial is meant to allow the SounderSIPS team to get up and running in the Unity Science Data System environment and begin using Unity services. 

### Getting Started with this tutorial


In Jupyter hub, we want to start a new terminal process. After logging in, the launcher allows us to open a new terminal:

![jupyterlab launcher](/img/jl_01.png)

Specifically, the 'terminal' icon under 'Other':

![terminal icon](/img/jl_02.png)

Double click this to open a new terminal. Once the terminal is open, enter the following command to clone the tutorial repository to your local environment. Once it's in the local environment, you can modify or change anything you'd like without affecting the tutorials in the github repository.

```
jovyan@jupyter-gangl:~$
git clone https://github.com/unity-sds/sounder-sips-tutorial.git
```
After a few seconds, you should see a folder called 'sounder-sips-tutorial' in the file navigator on the left hand side:

![tutorial folder](/img/jl_03.png)

Simply double click on that folder to view the contents of the repository within your own jupyter environment. To access the welcome notebook, click:

```
sounder-sips-tutorial > jupyter-notebooks > welcome.ipynb
```

To access a specific tutorial, click:

```
sounder-sips-tutorial > jupyter-notebooks > tutorials
```

You are now free to follow along with the tutorials.
