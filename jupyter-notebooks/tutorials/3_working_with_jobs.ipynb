    "# Working with Jobs\n",
    "Unity helps teams move quickly from algorithm development and testing in Jupyter into large-scale processing with the Scaled Processing System (SPS). In order to do this, algorithms developed in Jupyter must be registered in the Application Catalog (see 1_working_with_applications.ipynb), deployed to an Application Deployment and Execution Service (ADES) in SPS, and then may be run on the SPS as _jobs_.\n",

    "## 1. Deploy a job\n",
    "Before deploying Applications and working with jobs, it is assumed that a system administrator has deployed an ADES. These are often called \"venues\" or \"environments\", and some examples may be dev, test, prod, etc. To run a job, you need an an Application to deployed as well. In this case we have a demo application deployed and referenced in the setup step 0 above.\n",

    "With an ADES and a deployed Application ready to accept our job, we can submit a job along with any input data or parameters that are needed (as defined by a template job definition for a particular Application). In this example case, none are needed so `inputs` is blank. The response will provide a Job ID that we will store in a variable called `job_id` for use later."
